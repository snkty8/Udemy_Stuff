## Milestone Project 1
### TIC TAC TOE

The purpose of milestone 1 was to create a TIC TAC TOE game playable for 2 players using functions.

    Step 1: I wrote a function that can print out a board.  It was set up as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so get a 3 by 3 board representation.
    Step 2: Wrote a function that can take a player input and assign a marker as X or O.
    Step 3: Wrote a funtion that takes in the board list object, marker X or O, and a desired postion (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.
    Step 4: Wrote a funtion that takes in a board and checkes to see if someone has won.
    Step 5: Wrote a function that uses the random module to randomly decides which player goes first.
    Step 6: Wrote a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.
    Step 7: Wrote a function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value.  True if full, False otherwise.
    Step 8: Wrote a function that asks for a players next positon (as a number 1-9), then uses the function from step 6 to check if its a free position.  If it is, then return the posiiton for later use.
    Step 9: Wrote a function that askes the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean.  True if they do want to play again.
    Step 10: Used while loops and the functions above to run the game.
