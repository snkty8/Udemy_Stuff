## Milestone Project 1
    - TIC TAC TOE

    The purpose of milestone 1 was to create a TIC TAC TOE game playable for 2 players using functions.

    Step 1: I wrote a function that can print out a board.  It was set up as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so get a 3 by 3 board representation.
    Step 2: Wrote a function that can take a player input and assign a marker as X or O.
    Step 3: Wrote a funtion that takes in the board list object, marker X or O, and a desired postion (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.
